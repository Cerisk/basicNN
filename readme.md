This is a basic neural network program that goes through and explains 2 and 3 layer neural network.

Code was mostly reused from this article with some modifications: https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/

I added some more further documentation for each of these networks to develop a better understanding for how it actually works.

Includes some notes for future possible documentation changes:
    - Import csv files as inputs
    - Display results in a visual data
        - Nodes
        - S-Curve
